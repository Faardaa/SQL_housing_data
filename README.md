# SQL_housing_data
In this project, I've worked with a table named 'NashVillieHousing' that contains information such as date, address, owner address, uniqueID, salePrice, and more. The focus of the code is on data cleaning, where I've implemented processes to enhance the quality and reliability of the dataset.
